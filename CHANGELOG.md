### Design Decisions

- **Mint Green Strings (#64ffda)**: Selected for string literals to provide clear distinction from other syntax elements
- **Light Blue Functions (#82b1ff)**: Applied to function names and calls for easy identification of callable elements
- **Purple-Gray Comments (#8b7a9b)**: Subtle color that keeps comments visible but not distracting
